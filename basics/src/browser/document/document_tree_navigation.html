<!--
Although the script is outside the <body> in the source HTML, the browser relocates it
into <body> during HTML parsing to produce a valid DOM. JavaScript operates on this parsed
DOM, not on the original markup. So in the console code inside the script tag is also
logged as well. since <script> will also be a child of body.

According to the HTML spec:
  <script> is not allowed as a direct child of <html>. It must be inside <head> or <body>
  So browser rearranges <script> and puts it inside the body
-->
<script>
  console.log('Something!');
  // logging all children of the body
  for (let child of document.body.children) {
    console.log(child.innerHTML); // Text, DIV, Text, UL, ..., SCRIPT
  }
</script>
